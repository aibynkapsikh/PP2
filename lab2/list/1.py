# Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.



# Lists are created using square brackets:

mylist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(mylist)

# List length

# To determine how many items a list has, use the len() function:
print(len(mylist))

# A list can contain different data types:

list1 = ["abc", 34, True, 40, "male"]

# type
# From Python's perspective, lists are defined as objects with the data type 'list':
print(type(mylist))

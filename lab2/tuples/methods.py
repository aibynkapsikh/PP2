# Tuple Methods

# Python has two built-in methods that you can use on tuples.

# Method count

thistuple = (1, 3, 7, 8, 7, 5, 4, 6, 8, 5)

x = thistuple.count(5) # Return the number of times the value 5 appears in the tuple:

print(x) 

# Method index 

y = thistuple.index(8) # Search for the first occurrence of the value 8, and return its position:

print(y)
